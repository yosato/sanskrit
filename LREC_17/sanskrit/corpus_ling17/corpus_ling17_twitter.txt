Quantifying 'standardness' of the language use in a locality: a study with Twitter data

In this work we present a probabilistic method to quantify the distance of a corpus from the standard model. We then apply this metric to show that the degree to which the actual language use deviates from the standard significantly varies from region to region. Specifically, with the Twitter data coming from four broad regions in Japan, Tohoku, Kansai, Chugoku and Kyushu (about 17,000 tweets each), we observe widely differing distances, suggesting the readiness to conform to the standard language varies between regions.

We started by training a model of standard Japanese with a newspaper corpus. For this training, as well as for computing the plausibility of a sentence, we use the morphological analysis tool MeCab (Kudo et al 2004). MeCab employs the CRF algorithm (Lafferty et al. [year tbc]) for training, and computes the 'cost' based on the probability of a sentence, taking various features into account, including the right and left contexts. Generally it tells you how plausible a sentence is as a whole, relative to the model.

We then confirmed the expectation that greater costs are in fact associated with dialects, using pre-classified parallel dialect corpora developed by Yoshino et al. (2016), in which the standard Japanese corpus is translated into the dialects of the above four regions. These average costs form the basis of their respective expected costs. We then process our region-classified Twitter data to obtain the respective average costs. The distance for each region is obtained by subtracting the first cost from the second (average Twitter cost minus expected cost).

Tohoku 56,148 - 30,301  = 25,847
Kansai 31,646 - 32,279 = -633
Chugoku 32,477 - 31,876 = 571
Kyushu 39,649 - 31,012 = 8,637

The results show that for our four regions, the size of deviation from the standard language varies. In our case, Kansai dialect speakers seem most willing to adhere to their own dialect, while Tohoku dialect speakers are the least willing. In fact, the latter is the only region that shows no significant difference at all from the cost we also measured for Kanto, the standard Japanese speaking region (29,747). 

We envisage two main extensions of research that uses our quantitative approach presented above. One is the application to sociolinguistic studies on the dialect image, ... some refs maybe a non-japanese one?

On the practical side, we plan to extend our research to unsupervised dialect clustering. The main limitation of our method is that it is blind to the type of deviations a sentence may exhibit, and hence, there is no guarantee that the value represents a dialectal difference. We consider therefore integrating another metric, such as vocabulary share rate as used in Inoue (2002), to be able to achieve this goal.
