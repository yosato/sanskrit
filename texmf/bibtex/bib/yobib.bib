  abstract = {A principle of efficient language production based on information
	theoretic considerations is proposed: Uniform Information Density
	predicts that language production is affected by a preference to
	distribute information uniformly across the linguistic signal. This
	prediction is tested against data from syntactic reduction. A single
	multilevel logit model analysis of naturally distributed data from
	a corpus of spontaneous speech is used to assess the effect of information
	density on complementizer that-mentioning, while simultaneously evaluating
	the predictions of several influential alternative accounts: availability,
	ambiguity avoidance, and dependency processing accounts. Information
	density emerges as an important predictor of speakers’ preferences
	during production. As information is defined in terms of probabilities,
	it follows that production is probability-sensitive, in that speakers’
	preferences are affected by the contextual probability of syntactic
	structures. The merits of a corpus-based approach to the study of
	language production are discussed as well.},

  abstract = {This paper reports 2 studies that explore the role of joint attentional
	processes in the child's acquisition of language. In the first study,
	24 children were videotaped at 15 and 21 months of age in naturalistic
	interaction with their mothers. Episodes of joint attentional focus
	between mother and child-for example, joint play with an object-were
	identified. Inside, as opposed to outside, these episodes both mothers
	and children produced more utterances, mothers used shorter sentences
	and more comments, and dyads engaged in longer conversations. Inside
	joint episodes maternal references to objects that were already the
	child's focus of attention were positively correlated with the child's
	vocabulary at 21 months, while object references that attempted to
	redirect the child's attention were negatively correlated. No measures
	from outside these episodes related to child language. In an experimental
	study, an adult attempted to teach novel words to 10 17-month-old
	children. Words referring to objects on which the child's attention
	was already focused were learned better than words presented in an
	attempt to redirect the child's attentional focus.},
