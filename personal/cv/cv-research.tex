\section*{Research positions}

\begin{itemize}

\item \hspace{-2mm}Natural Language Processing Research Engineer, MyScript Lab,  2012--to date.

\hspace{-2mm}Duties: Building principally statistical language models for handwriting recognition and input comple- tion and prediction. Main responsibilities include: morphological processing and learning algorighms based on corpora, as applicable to a wide range of languages (but with a special focus on Japanese and Korean); various N-Gram modelling with multi-word expression detection capability; adaptation of models to individuals and dialects

\item \hspace{-.2cm}Research Fellow in Computational Linguistics,
  University of Hertfordshire, Jan 2009--Mar 2015 (Visiting Fellow from Mar 2012)

\hspace{-.2cm}Duties: Building a language acquisition model, including implementations of  grammar induction and phonological word discovery algorithms for `ITALK' (Integration and Transfer of Action and Language Knowledge in Robots), a European FP7 Framework Project  \\

\item \hspace{-.2cm}Research Assistant, Computer Science Dept, Queen
  Mary University of London, Jan 2008-- Jan 2009.

\hspace{-.2cm}Duties: A year contract for `Dynamics of Conversational
Dialogue', an Economic and Social Science Research Council (UK)
project awarded to King's and Queen Mary Colleges, London University. Responsible for building a parser based on the Dynamic Syntax formalism and a formal model of ellipsis.

\item \hspace{-.2cm}Doctoral Trainee, Computer Science Dept, King's
  College London, Sep 2004-- Feb 2008.

\hspace{-.2cm}Duties: Construction of natural language parser based on
HPSG for freer word order languages, supervised by Professor Shalom
Lappin, funded by the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council, U.K.
